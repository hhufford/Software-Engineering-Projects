C02A Eclipse and Java

1. File->Revert reverts the file to the last saved version. In other words, it undoes everything that has happened
	since you last saved the file.
2. It starts by printing the question, Who's coming to the Party? to the screen. Then it enters the 
    loop, and for each friend in the ArrayList of friend objects, it prints out information about each 
    person (their name and email) based on the toString function in the Friend class. In the debugging 
    mode, you can see each part of what the loop is doing.
3. The program no longer knows how to print out a Friend object. The toString function allowed us to
	specify how we wanted the object's information to be presented when system.out.println is used. 
	Therefore, it printed out what appears to be the memory address at which each friend object is 
	stored.
